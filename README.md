# Trippin Worldwide

## Description

Our Application is live: [Click this link to visit our site](https://trippin-worldwide.herokuapp.com/)

This application will provide a user the ability to journalize information about their travels such as description, start and end dates, city and country, activities, and cuisine as well as provide an opportunity to review/comment on other users' adventures. In addition, the most visited cities will be displayed via a map to help plan any future journeys.

The web application uses Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, Handlebars.js as a templating engine, MySQL and Sequelize ORM for the database, dotenv and bcrypt for securing sensitive data, bootstrap/CSS for styling, AWS S3 Bucket for storage, and Google Maps Geocoding and JavaScript APIs for mapping locations visited within a map view.

## Requirements

Requirements for this project use skills and technologies learned over the past six weeks (server-side JavaScript, RESTful APIs, databases, object-relational mapping, environment variables, templating, and authentication) as well as new technologies learned during the project (Google Maps API, AWS S3 Bucket Storage).

### Project Requirements:

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

- Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

- Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

- Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

- Add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.
